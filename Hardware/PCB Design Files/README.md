# PCB Design Files

This Folder contains the PCB design files (board and schematic files) and gerber files for PCB ordering.

There is also a bill of materials from Mouser for all of the required components.

The battery used for the prototype was an 800mAh battery, chosen as the breadboard version had a peak current draw of ~650mA so a battery of at least 650mAh was required, assuming max discharge rate of 1C. The battery chosen is available at: https://cpc.farnell.com/unbranded/lp-573442-1s-3/battery-li-polymer-3-7v-800mah/dp/BT06808?st=bt06808

As mentioned in the root of the repo, the actuator chosen was powerhap TDK's 1313 actuator. To connect it to this design a JST-PH crimping set is also required.
