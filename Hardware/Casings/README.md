# Casing 3D Designs

This folder contains the required 3D models for the casings of the device.

Info:
- All of the above was printed in PETG, a thermally resistant, semi-flexible material good for wearable projects.

- Some desings have a triangle fin attached for ease of 3D printing which can then be cracked off and filed till smooth.
  
- The main housing has wings to attach material for a strap which can then be buckled with the given buckle design (this buckle design includes a slot for the actuator so it can be inserted before tightening and placed on the wrist)

- The actuator casing serves to increase pressure on the skin (making the vibrations feel stronger) and insulate it (reduicng EEG artefacts) though tape on the skin it is placed may also be necessary to prevent sweat ingress. This can then be tightly taped to the skin with appropriate tape or held in place with the buckle as mentioned above.

- The battery leads should be cut and soldered to the corresponding magnetic connector terminals (view the PCB to see which pin is which). The battery can then be slotted into the battery holder - the magnetic conncetor glued into the battery lid and the lid blued into the holder. Creating a standalone battery pack. Note: the battery should be relatively loose in the holder when placing it in, li-po batteries may expands and this msut be accounted for.

- The button can be placed into the recess in the wall of the main housing before the PCB is inserted, after which it will be held in place by the button.
